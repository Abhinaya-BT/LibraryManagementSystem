                                      LibraryManagementSystem

Description of the Program:

This project is a Library Management System created using Java.
It is a console-based program where users can manage the basic operations of a library.

It allows the user to:

  *Add new books to the library.

  *Register borrowers (library members).

  *Borrow books and record the transaction.

  *Return books and update records.

  *View the list of books, borrowers, and transactions.


The program uses object-oriented programming concepts by creating classes like Book, Borrower, Transaction, and Library.



Purpose of the Program:

  *The main purpose of this program is to:

  *Organize and manage library operations easily.

  *Track which books are available and which are borrowed.

  *Record who borrowed which book and when it was returned.

  *Practice object-oriented programming (OOP) skills like classes, objects, and methods.


It simulates the real-world process of how a library works, but in a simple, beginner-friendly way.



How the Program Works (Simple Explanation):

1. Start the program:
When you run it, a menu appears with different options like Add Book, Add Borrower, Borrow Book, Return Book, View Lists, Exit.


2. Add Books:
You can add new books by entering their title and author.


3. Add Borrowers:
You can register people who want to borrow books by entering their name and ID.


4. Borrow a Book:
When someone borrows a book, you select the borrower's ID and the bookâ€™s title.
The program marks the book as unavailable and records the date of borrowing.


5. Return a Book:
When a book is returned, you enter the return date.
The program updates the transaction and makes the book available again.


6. View Lists:
You can see all the books, all the borrowers, and the full list of transactions.


7. Exit:
You can exit the program at any time by choosing Exit.




Technologies and Concepts Used:

  *Java Programming Language

  *Classes and Objects

  *ArrayList (for storing data)

  *Scanner (for taking input)

  *Condition checking (if, switch, for loops)

  *Menu-driven approach
