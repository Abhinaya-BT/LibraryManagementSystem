Description of the Program:

This project is a Library Management System created using Java.
It is a console-based program where users can manage the basic operations of a library.

It allows the user to:

Add new books to the library.

Register borrowers (library members).

Borrow books and record the transaction.

Return books and update records.

View the list of books, borrowers, and transactions.


The program uses object-oriented programming concepts by creating classes like Book, Borrower, Transaction, and Library.



Purpose of the Program:

The main purpose of this program is to:

Organize and manage library operations easily.

Track which books are available and which are borrowed.

Record who borrowed which book and when it was returned.

Practice object-oriented programming (OOP) skills like classes, objects, and methods.


It simulates the real-world process of how a library works, but in a simple, beginner-friendly way.



How the Program Works (Simple Explanation):

1. Start the program:
When you run it, a menu appears with different options like Add Book, Add Borrower, Borrow Book, Return Book, View Lists, Exit.


2. Add Books:
You can add new books by entering their title and author.


3. Add Borrowers:
You can register people who want to borrow books by entering their name and ID.


4. Borrow a Book:
When someone borrows a book, you select the borrower's ID and the book’s title.
The program marks the book as unavailable and records the date of borrowing.


5. Return a Book:
When a book is returned, you enter the return date.
The program updates the transaction and makes the book available again.


6. View Lists:
You can see all the books, all the borrowers, and the full list of transactions.


7. Exit:
You can exit the program at any time by choosing Exit.




Technologies and Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects

ArrayList (for storing data)

Scanner (for taking input)

Condition checking (if, switch, for loops)

Menu-driven approach
